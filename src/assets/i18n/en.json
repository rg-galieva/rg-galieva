  "about.part3": "The story of my relationships with web technologies begins in the distant 1999. When I created my first HTML-page about cats for programming class in the middle school.

Bragged to server developers with my application on Express.",
  "about.part5": "In mid-2012, I was bored and I plunged into the world of server Java development. After 6 months of debugging errors in the console, I decided to test the sass, Backbone, and grunt. After that, I could not find the strength to come back.",
